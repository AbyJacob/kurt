"""Python library for reading/writing Scratch project (.sb) and sprite files.

DEPENDENCIES:
    construct - for defining the format. 
                Homepage: http://construct.wikispaces.com/
                ["construct" in the Python package index]

USAGE:
    You'll probably just want to use the provided ScratchProjectFile and 
    ScratchSpriteFile classes. Pass them the path to the file and use their 
    provided .save() methods. Access them using:
        from kurt.files import *
    
    Most of the objects you're interested in, like ScratchStageMorph and 
    ScratchSpriteMorph, inherit from UserObject. You can use .fields.keys() 
    to see the available fields on one of these objects.
    
    FixedObjects have a .value property to access their value. Inline objects, 
    such as int and bool, are converted to their Pythonic counterparts. Array 
    and Dictionary are converted to list and dict.
    
    Tested with Python 2.6. Works with Scratch 1.4; not tested with earlier versions, but probably works.
    
    Scratch is created by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. 
    See their website: http://scratch.mit.edu/

# TODO:
#   - Fill out all the _fields lists in user_objects.
#   - Implement some nice Pythonic classes for manipulating scripts.
#   - Optimise ObjectNetworkAdapter for building large files.
